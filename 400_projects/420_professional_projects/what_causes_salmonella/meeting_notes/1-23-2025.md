# Meeting with Dr. A
- I have to collaborate with IT about data storage.
- I showed the results of the very basic, preliminary lanchain system to Dr. A. We discussed what was happening. Turns out, setting up that simple a system and asking such simple questions will always yield such simple responses. **So we don't need to ask it such simple querries**.
- To make it better, do the following as your next step: 
	- Tell it what role it has to assume and provide an objective. Describe the data at hand. In particular, describe the variables. If there's any information available online about correlational behaviors between the variables or any other information that might help in completing its objective, provide it to the LLM. 
	- Collect your results and store them.
	- Some example sentences that could help it to 'reason':
		- Statement about importance of variables: Variables (x1, x2) are equally important and Variables (x3 and x4) are twice as important as x1 and x2. 
	- Vary the temperature.
- Discuss with the team which variables they think are most important. #review
