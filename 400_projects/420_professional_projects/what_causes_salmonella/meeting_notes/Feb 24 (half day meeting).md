| Dr. Anderson and Clark discuss plans for developing a database and AI system for analyzing public health data. They decide to start with a simple PostgreSQL database for initial testing before connecting to the larger One Health database. The team will reach out to the CDC for permission to use certain datasets, particularly the PulseNet data. Clark informs the group about potential upcoming changes at the university regarding AI research and data management, which may impact their project in the future. They plan to contact Abby O'Sullivan from university IT to discuss how their project might fit into the new ecosystem being developed for AI research on campus.                                                                                                                                                 |     |

| Clark discussed the potential for a redesign of their data environment, suggesting that it could be moved to the company to ensure long-term security and scalability. He emphasized the importance of getting everyone's buy-in on the design and structure of the databases. Clark also mentioned the possibility of deriving valuable analytics and data from the free data they are currently using, which could potentially be sold. He suggested that the team should start to involve Abby in these discussions, as she would be concerned about data and privacy security. Clark also mentioned the need to navigate the complexities of patent filings and licensing, and suggested that the team should consult with experts like Marilyn Rance and Mahmoud for guidance on these matters.                                           |     |

| Clark discusses the implications of recent executive orders and NSF changes on their social vulnerability index work. He advises the team to be cautious about publishing or analyzing data that points to specific minority or ethnic groups, as their grant was flagged for benefiting underserved populations. Clark suggests focusing on the process and algorithms rather than the specific application to social vulnerability. He recommends reviewing the variables used in their analysis to ensure they are not explicitly tied to sensitive demographics. The team considers how to proceed with their research while avoiding potential scrutiny, possibly by generalizing their approach and being careful about the language used in communications and publications.                                                            |     |

| Clark discusses various prompt engineering techniques to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs). He explains the self-consistency method, which involves providing multiple examples to guide the model's reasoning, and the divide-and-conquer approach, which breaks down complex problems into simpler steps. Clark also mentions the use of embeddings, particularly Facebook's FaISS library, to efficiently encode domain-specific data for LLMs. He suggests testing different prompt engineering methods and embeddings to find the most effective approach for their specific use case. Clark emphasizes the importance of creating a gold standard set of questions to evaluate the model's performance and proposes a plan to gather questions from team members and advisory board members to build this dataset. |     |

| Clark discussed the limitations and workings of large language models (LLMs). He explained that LLMs don't see text but tokens, which are numeric encodings of text. He also highlighted the challenges of controlling the quality of information given to LLMs, as more contextual information can lead to hallucinations. Clark suggested defining metrics, input restrictions, and varying levels of complexity for better performance. He also discussed the need for frequent updates to LLMs, which could be achieved through a combination of contextual prior prompts and Facebook embeddings. The team agreed to consider the frequency of updates based on the types of questions users would ask.                                                                                                                                   |     |

| Clark and the team discussed the development of a dashboard for their project. They agreed on the need for a well-controlled dashboard with a set of essential questions that would be asked by users. The team decided to start with a finite set of questions, initially around 20, to test the system and then potentially open it up for more open-ended questions. The dashboard would be tailored to different user groups, such as public health officials and the poultry supply chain. Clark emphasized the importance of starting with a few structured questions to ensure the system's success before moving to open-ended questioning. The team also discussed the integration of maps and the use of multi-modal models for the dashboard.                                                                                       |     |

| Clark discussed the use of prompt engineering in training models and the concept of instruct models. He explained the idea of using multiple Llms for different tasks and how they can be handled via prompt engineering. Clark also introduced the concept of a planner Llm, which creates a plan based on a user's query and assigns each step to the most suitable Llm and data set pair. He discussed the idea of giving the Llm the least amount of control possible and making the process trackable and accountable. Finally, Clark mentioned the idea of using different tools for each task and how the results from these tools can be collected and converted into a human-readable format by the reasoner Llm.                                                                                                                     |     |

| Clark outlined an action plan to develop a clear and efficient system for processing information. He suggested that data from various sources should be structured into a database for easy access and use. Each group should come up with five questions, categorizing them as easy, medium, or hard, and present a diagram to the larger group to ensure understanding of their needs. The system should be approved by CDC. The immediate needs are questions and approval for pulsive, as well as identifying which variables to use for maps and configuring them. It was also discussed that input data could be translated into a data summary, potentially reducing the need for multi-modal systems.                                                                                                                                  |     |

| The group discusses the progress and challenges in AI and computer vision, reflecting on the historical developments and current shifts in the field. They also address the complexities of their current grant project, including the need to balance academic research with potential product development. The team agrees to focus on using local, lesser-quality language models for their initial work to avoid data privacy issues. They plan to follow up on social vulnerability index (SVI) questions and seek input from their advisory board. Clark mentions he will be unavailable for the upcoming Wednesday meeting due to travel to the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
