# Ramblings
- Can we use a smaller LLM to make predictions on how many tokens a larger model would require to explain something? (TLDR: Use smaller models for token length prediction)
- Text generation
	- If previous_text.exists(), - *complete text*
	- use summary of progress.
- Maintain a dynamic character sheet (use timestamps)
	- LM should use the latest one
- Diversity assessor should see all generated scenes, compare them and then select the best.
- Show experiments
	- with and without diversity assessor
	- with and without novel metadata in sys propmpt
	- with and without outline in scene writer
	- can it maintain 'quote consistency'
