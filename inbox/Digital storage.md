Right now, I'm using my local storage, a google drive for my personal documents and a university onedrive for university-related work. 
I think I should implement a self-hosted solution for everything. Until then, my workflow is the following.
# For university-related 'documentation' work:
- For university-related documentation work, use MS online tools.
- If you need to incorporate vector graphics, use inkscape. Do the work and keep in `~/Documents/temp/`. 
- Move the document to the relevant cloud folder.
# For coding related work
- Use normal workflows with git.
# For reading documents
- Keep in local system
- Always have the document backed up
- Schedule backups.
