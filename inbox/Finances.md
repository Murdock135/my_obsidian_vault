# PC + Laptop + tablet buying strategy
1. Sell ipad and buy all pc components except GPU (done)
2. Finance GPU with dad's money.
3. Sell Laptop and buy Macbook pro M1 (doing)
4. Trade in iphone for samsung tab s9 and finance using Samsung financing.
How to pay off
1. Pay back baba at $50/mo (600/50 = 12 months)
2. Pay samsung over 24 mo (460/24 ~ $19/mo)

## Macbook M1
- Borrowed 650 from dad for macbook M1
- Returned M1 air for 650 dollars.
- Bought a M1 pro for 850.
- Got 530 by selling ipad
Remaining= 850-530= 320
Plan: Pay back dad 320 at 64/mo = 5 months
## PC components
- Used 830 from amex
- Returned mobo and got back 99
Remaining = 730
- Selling laptop for 700
Remaining= 30
Plan: After selling laptop, transfer 730 into Amex.
Edit (Feb 11): 533 remaining. Create auto payment of 53/mo
## GPU:
- Borrow 600 from Amex and pay at 600/10 = 60/mo
## Monitor
MSI monitor 42/mo for 6 months.
# Samsung tablet
- Use Affirm to pay the cost (400) at 450/10 = 40/mo

# Car payments (except insurance)
Note: I paid for insurance with dad's money so that calculation will be in the [[#Debt Payments]] section.
```math
monthly = 271/2
total = monthly
```
- Set up 111.333 for 6 months to baba.
# Debt Payments
1. ~~Pay 110/mo to Amex for 10 months (60/mo for GPU )~~
2. PC (to Amex) Pay 533/10 = 54 for 10 months
3. laptop (to dad): Pay 64/mo to dad for 5 months
4. insurance (to dad): Pay 111.333 to dad for 6 months.
5. tablet (to Samsung): Pay 40 a month for 10 months
6. Pay 50/mo (to dad) for all the loans until now.
```math
PC = 533/9 #payin9mo
tablet = 400/10 #payin10mo
laptop = 320/5 #payin5mo
monitor = 42 #payin3mo
insurance = 1336/(6*2) #payin6mo
misc_debts = 1000/20 #payin20mo
total = PC + tablet + laptop + monitor + insurance + misc_debts
```


# Monthly expenses
```math
rent = 650
debt = 366.566
car = 135.5
mizzou_fees = 127
total = rent + debt + mizzou_fees
```

# Manual Payment plans
```math
to_amex = 54 #10mo
to_dad_for_laptop = 64 #5mo
to_dad_insurance = 111.333 #6mo
to_dad_misc = 50 #20mo
total_to_dad = to_dad_for_laptop + to_dad_insurance + to_dad_misc
total_in_plan = to_amex + to_dad_for_laptop + to_dad_insurance + to_dad_misc
```
