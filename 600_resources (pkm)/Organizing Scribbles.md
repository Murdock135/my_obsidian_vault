Scribbles are chaotic, spur-of-the-moment thoughts or rough attempts at understanding something. There should be no administration or bureaucracy associated with creating scribbles. The only thing to do is to store them after done scribbling. 
Adding a date to a scribble doesn't add value since a scribble's validity is perpetual. Even if the scribble was made years ago, there might be something valuable in it for your current project. 
# Summary
- Scan and store into google drive after done scribbling.
- Summarize what you scribbled about when you have time (Preferably right after. Just takes max 5m).
- Don't add a date.
- If the scribble is rejected entirely, move into 'archived' folder.
