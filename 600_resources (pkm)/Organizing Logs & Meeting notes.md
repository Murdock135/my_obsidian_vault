Logs are brief descriptions of what you worked on, usually marked by time. But under the surface, logs carry a lot of information. Things like *why* you spent time on that work and if the work helps produce more work in the future or if this task is something you're stuck on and perhaps need advice on. We forego all this information for simply having a record of what we worked on, which adds minimal productivity. 
But how do we make logs actionable? Firstly, logs are part of a task, which is part of a project. Secondly, logs can (and should) contain information on whether you found any interesting results, whether the task referred to in the log gave birth to a new task (to-do), etc. The simplest thing we can think of is to add tags, which we can filter and find logs efficiently, which we can then act upon. So I use the following structure <\#project>\#task><#\status><#\priority><\#optional tags>, for example: ==\#salmonella_study\#merging\#continue\#low_priority==. I'm using the following status tags:
1. \#continue
2. \#discontinued
I recommend the following optional tags:
1. \#update
2. \#fix
