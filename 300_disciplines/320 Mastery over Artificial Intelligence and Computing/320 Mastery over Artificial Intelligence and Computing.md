# 1. Introduction
This is a discipline-representation of my professional life. This discipline contributes to achieving my ikigai by __ . The name 'Mastery over Artificial Intelligence and Computing' defines an 'infinite' discipline that never ends and the pillars are as follows-
# Pillars
Note: ! indicate the relative estimated duration for learning it to a sufficient level.
1. Computer Architecture !!!
2. Artificial Intelligence concepts !!!!
3. Database technologies !
4. Networking !
5. Physics driven Game development !!!!
6. Cybersecurity !!!
# 2. Roadmap
The following roadmap sets targets to learn about previously discovered or invented concepts which will hopefully help me invent/discover/advance something related to 'artificial intelligence and computing'.

**Fundamentals**
Probability(Henry Stark) + Linear Algebra (G. Strang) + Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential forms, a unified approach (Hubbard)→ High dimensional probability
**Main**
PRML + Deep Learning
⬇️
**Few more topics**
Reinforcement learning + NLP
⬇️
**Philosophical dive**
Jayne’s probability + AI (Russel + Norvig)
⬇️
**First step into the deep ocean**
Machine learning from theory to algorithms (Shai Shalev) (Measure theoretical)
