# Introduction
**Who I am**: I live in Missouri, USA as a foreign graduate student. I will apply for NIW (National interest waiver) after a few years, approximately 3. My current salary is 2000 and will stay like this for the next 3 years. My salary will jump to about 120000 after 4 years. My monthly cost for grocery and dining is 500. My monthly tuition payment is 117 but that is only paid for 8 months. My rent+utilities is 560. I pay 200 for my financing plan and insurance on my car (I will eventually refinance this for a better rate). 

**My goal**: I want to make necessary savings for (1) an emergency fund of 2000 by 1 year (2) once a year trip to bangladesh (2500) and once a year trip to somewhere else (1000) (3) Financing a house in ideally 5 years and worst case 10 years (3) Everything related to the NIW.

- **Annual Trips:** Save $292 monthly to cover $3,500 annually for travel, starting from the second year.
- **NIW Application:** Begin saving $125 monthly immediately to accumulate approximately $4,500 over three years, covering estimated costs.
- **House Down Payment:** After the salary increase in year 4, allocate $1,500 monthly to save $60,000 in 40 months (approximately 3.3 years), aligning with your 5-year goal.
- **Discretionary Spending:** Remaining funds can be used for shopping, entertainment, or additional savings.

This plan ensures that you meet your financial goals within the specified timeframes while maintaining a balanced budget for living expenses and discretionary spending. Adjustments can be made based on changes in expenses, income, or financial priorities.
